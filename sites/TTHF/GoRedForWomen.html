        FOR WOMEN</h1></div>
       <div class="let"> <p>The 'Go Red for Women Campaign' is a Health and Wellness programme for women geared 
            towards heightening awareness of cardiovascular disease in women, due to the high mortality rate among women as a result of heart disease. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the No. 1 
            killer of women, causing 1 in 3 deaths each year and claiming the lives of 8.6 million women 
            globally every year as a result of heart attacks and strokes. CVD claims the life of one woman 
            every 80 seconds but up to 80 percent of cardiovascular diseases may be prevented. Trinidad 
            and Tobago, however, is not exempted as the main cause of death each year among its citizens is cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 50% of these deaths attributed to CVD are women. 
            Despite these alarming numbers, the good news is cardiovascular disease is preventable. 
            The TTHF launched its GO RED For Women Campaign in November 2014 and made it one 
            of the cornerstones of its awareness programmes. It is a passionate and vibrant initiative designed to empower women to focus on and take charge of their heart health. The TTHF has 
            taken up the mantle to bring the campaign to Trinidad and Tobago, to dispel the myth that 
            heart disease is a man’s problem. In truth, heart disease can affect women just as much or 
            even more than men and claims more women’s lives than all forms of cancer combined. The 
            TTHF partners with local and international humanitarian organizations and NGOs to bring 
            awareness to the women of Trinidad and Tobago under our local 'GO RED for Women Campaign'. The Go Red For Women and the Red Dress logo encourages awareness and action 
            to save more women's lives. The movement harnesses the energy and power women have 
            to band together and collectively wipe out heart disease. It challenges them to know their 
            risk for heart disease and take action to reduce their personal risk. It also gives them the tools 
            they need to lead a heart healthy life.</p></div>
