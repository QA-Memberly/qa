            <ul style="letter-spacing:1px; font-weight: lighter;">
                <li>Read the Nutrition Facts label while shopping to find foods that have less than 5% of 
                    the daily value of sodium per serving.</li>
                    <li>Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen fruits and vegetables without sauce, and 
                        canned vegetables with no added salt</li>
                        <li>Limit processed foods high in sodium.</li>
                        <li>Consider eating more meals at home</li>
                        <li>Use alternatives such as herbs and spices instead of salt when cooking</li>
                        <li>When buying packaged or prepared foods, choose foods labelled “low sodium,” 
                            “reduced sodium,” or “no salt added.</li>

            <h3>WHAT ARE THE COMMON SIGNS OF HEART ATTACK?</h3>
            <p style="letter-spacing:1px;">While some heart attacks are intense and sudden, many others start slowly with more subtle 
                symptoms. Heart attacks can manifest as chest pain, tightness, or discomfort. Sometimes 
                even shortness of breath can be a symptom of a heart attack. Any unusual restriction in your 
                activity could be a warning sign of heart disease. Dizziness or a fast or irregular heartbeat 
                are other possible symptoms</p>

                <h3>What is CPR and when should i use it?</h3>
                <p style="letter-spacing:1px ;">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure that can help save a 
                    person’s life if their breathing or heart stops. When a person’s heart stops beating, they are 
                    in cardiac arrest. During cardiac arrest, the heart cannot pump blood to the rest of the 
                    body, including the brain and lungs. Death can happen in minutes without treatment. CPR 
                    uses chest compressions to mimic how the heart pumps. These compressions help keep 
                    blood flowing throughout the body. Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack.
                    A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. A person having a heart 
                    attack is still talking and breathing. This person does not need CPR—but they do need to 
                    get to the hospital right away. Heart attack increases the risk for going into cardiac arrest.</p>

                    <h3>HANDS ONLY CPR: HOW TO DO IT?</h3>
                    <p style="letter-spacing: 1px;">Push down hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 pushes a minute. 
                         Let the chest come back up to its normal position after each push. It is recommended that 
                         you time your pushes to the beat of the song “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees. This method 
                         of CPR is called “hands-only” and does not involve breathing into the person’s mouth</p>
