                <div><span class="h4">WHAT IS CPR AND WHEN SHOULD I USE IT?</span>
            <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:14px"><br><b>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) </b> is an emergency procedure that can help save a 
                    person’s life if their breathing or heart stops. When a person’s heart stops beating, they are 
                    in <b>cardiac arrest </b>. During cardiac arrest, the heart cannot pump blood to the rest of the 
                    body, including the brain and lungs. Death can happen in minutes without treatment. CPR 
                    uses chest compressions to mimic how the heart pumps. These compressions help keep 
                    blood flowing throughout the body. <b>Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack.</b> 
                    A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. A person having a heart 
                    attack is still talking and breathing. This person does not need CPR—but they do need to 
                    get to the hospital right away. Heart attack increases the risk for going into cardiac arrest.</p></div><br>

                    <div><span class="h4">HANDS ONLY CPR: HOW TO DO IT?</span>
                  <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:14px"><br> Push down hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 pushes a minute. 
                         Let the chest come back up to its normal position after each push. It is recommended that 
                         you time your pushes to the beat of the song “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees. This method 
                         of CPR is called “hands-only” and does not involve breathing into the person’s mouth</p></div>
