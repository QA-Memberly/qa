 <p class="text-justify">Your heart is a vital organ. It is a muscle that pumps blood to all parts of your body. The blood pumped by your heart provides your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function. If you are of average weight and size, your body contains about five litres of blood, all of which passes through your heart every minute or so. However, when necessary, such as during exercise, your heart can pump up to four times that amount per minute.

<p class="text-justify" style="font-size:14px;"> Your heart is about the size of your clenched fist. It lies in the middle of your chest, behind and slightly to the left of your breastbone. </p>

        <span style="font-size:small"> <strong> Heart chambers:</strong></span> <br> 
        <p style="font-size:14px;" class="text-justify">Your heart has a right and a left side separated by a wall. Each side has a small collecting chamber called an ‘atrium’, which leads into a large pumping chamber called a ‘ventricle’. There are four chambers: the left atrium, right atrium (upper chambers), and left ventricle and right ventricle (lower chambers).</p> <br>
        <span style="font-size:small"><strong>Heart valves:</strong> </span> <br> 
        <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">Heart valves are like one-way doors that guard the entrance and exit of your heart’s chambers. They make sure that blood flows only in the right direction between the four chambers of your heart.
        </p> <br>
        <span style="font-size:small; font-weight:bold;">Your heart has four valves: </span> <br> 
        <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify"> <em><strong> The ‘tricuspid valve’    </strong></em>  on the right side of the heart, which lets the blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle   </p> <br>
        <p  style="font-size:14px"class="text-justify"> <em><strong> The ‘mitral valve’,      </strong> </em> on the left side of the heart, which lets blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle  </p> <br>
        <p  style="font-size:14px"class="text-justify"> <em><strong> The ‘pulmonary valve’</strong></em> on the right side of the heart, which lets blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs) </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px"class="text-justify">  <em><strong> The ‘aortic valve’   </strong></em> on the left side of the heart, which lets the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta.

        <div> <span class="h6">HOW YOUR HEART PUMPS BLOOD</span> <br>
        <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify" >The right side of your heart collects blood on its return from the rest of your body. The blood entering the right side of your heart is low in oxygen. This is because oxygen is removed from your blood as it circulates through your body’s organs and tissues. Your heart pumps the blood from the right side of your heart to your lungs so it can receive more oxygen. Once it has received oxygen, the returns directly to the left side of your heart, which it then pumps out again to all parts of your body through the aorta. The movement of your heart contracting and pumping blood is called ‘systole’. The movement of your heart relaxing so the chambers can refill with blood is called ‘diastole’. The left ventricle of your heart is larger and thicker than the right ventricle. This is because it has to pump the blood further around the body and against higher pressure, compared with the right ventricle. </p> <br>
        <span class="h6">CIRCULATION</span> <br>
        <p  style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">Your body has a network of blood vessels called arteries, veins and capillaries, which carry the blood pumped by your heart. Your heart and these blood vessels make up your circulatory system. Arteries carry blood away from your heart. The largest artery in your body is the aorta. It has branches that carry blood to your head, arms, legs and organs in your chest and abdomen. The first branches of the aorta are the coronary arteries. These run back to the outside surface of your heart to form a network of smaller arteries that supply your heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients. Smaller branch arteries feed into even smaller blood vessels called capillaries, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Oxygen and nutrients pass into the body tissues from your capillaries and then veins carry blood back to your heart.</p> <br>

            <span class="h6">ELECTRICAL SYSTEM</span> <br>
            <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">Normally heartbeats are set off by tiny electrical signals that come from your heart’s ‘natural pacemaker’ – a small area of your heart called the ‘sinus node’ that is located in the top of the right atrium. These signals travel rapidly throughout the atria to make sure that all the heart muscle fibres contract at the same time, pushing blood into the ventricles. These same electrical signals are passed on to the ventricles via the atrioventricular (AV) node and cause the ventricles to contract a short time later, after they have been filled with blood from the atria. This normal heart rhythm is known as the ‘sinus rhythm’, because it is controlled by the sinus node</p> <br>
            <span class="h6">PULSE</span>
            <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">Every heartbeat results in blood moving forward through your arteries. You can feel this movement as a ‘pulse’ by placing two fingers over the artery at your wrist. Your pulse rate tells you how fast your heart is beating.</p>

        <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">Cardiac arrest is an electrical problem which can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. A person in cardiac arrest will fall down or collapse and stop breathing and moving. They will die if they are not treated immediately. Cardiac arrests may be caused by a heart attack. The best treatment for cardiac arrest involves using a defibrillator. A defibrillator gives the person’s heart a controlled electric shock that may start it beating normally again. If a defibrillator is not available, you should begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) straight away and continue until the ambulance arrives. </p> <br>

    <div>
        <span class="h6">HEARTBEAT</span> <br>
        <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">With each heartbeat, blood is squeezed from the atria into the ventricles and then out to the rest of your body. After each contraction of the atria or ventricles, the inner flaps of the valves (often called cusps or leaflets) come together to seal off the chambers of your heart and make sure that the blood does not flow backwards. They are forced open again by the normal pumping action of your heart to allow forward blood flow. At rest, your heart beats approximately 60 to 100 times a minute. A child’s heart rate is higher than an adult’s heart rate. In an average lifetime, a heart will beat around 3 billion times. When you are physically active, excited or ill, your heart rate can rise significantly. This is a natural response to these situations</p>

        <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify"> <em>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number one cause of death globally resulting in an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. </em> More people die annually from CVDs than from any other non-communicable diseases even in Trinidad and Tobago. Heart disease affects the heart and blood vessels and can result in a number of problems, many of which are directly related to a process called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the gradual clogging of the arteries that supply blood to your heart, brain and other vital organs. Fatty material called plaque slowly builds up on the inner walls of the arteries causing them to narrow.  This increases the risk of a blood clot forming, which can block the artery cutting off the blood supply. This can cause a heart attack or stroke. Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be the first warning of underlying disease. There is no single cause of CVD, but there are risk factors that increase your chance of developing it. There are <strong> 'modifiable' risk factors </strong> (ones that you can control or change) and <strong> 'non-modifiable' risk factors </strong> (ones that you can't change).</p> <br>

    <span class="h6">HEART ATTACK SIGNS & SYMPTOMS </span> <br>
    <p style="font-size:14px" class="text-justify">A heart attack occurs when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely. This happens because coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood flow can slowly become narrow from a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances that together are called plaque. This process is known as atherosclerosis. This increases the likelihood that a blood clot will form. Blood clots can block the blood flow through the heart muscle causing parts of the heart muscle to be starved for oxygen, causing tissue damage or death. When damage or death of part of the heart muscle occurs, it is called a heart attack. Damage increases the longer an artery stays blocked. Once that muscle dies, the result is permanent heart damage. The warning signs of a heart attack vary from person to person.  You may have just one symptom or a combination. Some heart attacks are sudden and intense, but most start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort. A person experiencing a heart attack may not even be sure of what is happening. It's important to know the signs of a heart attack because people often misdiagnose or ignore the symptoms of a heart attack because they don’t think it could happen to them.</p> <br>

     <span style="font-size:12px ;">
        <li><strong>Smoking</strong>-Smoking hardens the arteries and forces the heart to work harder. Smokers have a much higher risk of having a heart attack than non-smokers. </li>
        <li><strong>High cholesterol </strong>-An imbalance of cholesterol in your blood can lead to a heart attack or stroke as it increases the likelihood of blockages, cutting off blood supply.</li>
        <li><strong>High blood pressure </strong> - If blood pressure is too high, it can damage the arteries making them susceptible to atherosclerosis and put strain on the heart. </li>
        <li><strong>Diabetes</strong> - Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease especially when combined with other risk factors. </li>
        <li><strong>Lack of physical activity </strong> - Not getting enough physical activity can negatively affect heart health. </li>
        <li><strong>Obesity</strong> - Being overweight or obese increases your risk of not only heart disease of developing other risk factors. </li>
        <li><strong>Unhealthy diet </strong> - Dietary habits can influence other risk factors, such as cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and being overweight.</li>
        <li><strong>Alcohol </strong> - Alcohol raises blood pressure and can affect your heart rhythm. The suggested serving is no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. </li>
        <li><strong>Stress</strong> - Stress may lead to risk factors such as high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, smoking and unhealthy diet.

    <p style="font-size:14px;" class="text-justify">The heart muscle begins to heal soon after a heart attack however; scar tissue may form in the damaged area, which does not contract or pump as well as healthy muscle tissue. The degree of loss of function depends on the size and location of the scar tissue. Heart attack survivors have to make important lifestyle changes and possibly take medication to prevent a future heart attack and lead a full, productive life including: Quit Smoking, Physical Activity, Healthy eating, Maintaining a healthy weight & Taking Medication as prescribed.</p>

   <span class="h6">STROKE</span> <br>
   <p style="font-size:14px;" class="text-justify">A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures). When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood and oxygen it needs, so brain cells die. If a stroke occurs and blood flow can't reach the region that controls a particular body function that part of the body won't work as it should. For example, someone who had a small stroke may only have minor problems such as temporary weakness of an arm or leg. People who have larger strokes may be permanently paralyzed on one side of their body or lose their ability to speak. Some people recover completely while some survivors may have some type of long-term disability. </p>
<br>
<span class="h6">TYPES OF STROKE </span> <br>
<span style="font-size:12px ;">
<li><strong>Ischemic Stroke </strong> - caused either by a clot obstructing the flow of blood to the brain. </li>
<li><strong>Haemorrhagic Stroke </strong> - caused by a blood vessel rupturing and preventing blood flow to the brain. While the lesser occurring of the two types of stroke it most often results in death. </li>
<li><strong>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or "mini stroke" </strong> - caused when blood flow to part of the brain stops for a short period of time, it can mimic stroke-like symptoms. These can appear and last less than 24 hours before disappearing as the blood supply to your brain is restored before the brain is permanently damaged.</li> <br>

<span class="h6">STROKE RISK FACTORS</span> <br>
<span>
    <li><strong>Age</strong> - Risk increases as you get older due to a natural hardening of the arteries as we age. </li>
    <li><strong>Family History </strong> - Having a family history of stroke increases your risk. </li>
    <li><strong>Gender</strong> - Men are more likely than women to have strokes. However, women are more likely to die from strokes. Additionally, pregnant women or women using birth control pills may be at a slightly higher risk. </li>
    <li><strong>High Blood Pressure </strong> - High blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure weakens blood vessels, making it more likely for a blockage or a blood vessel in the brain to bleed, which can lead to stroke. </li>
    <li><strong>Smoking</strong> - Smoking raises blood pressure and can damage blood vessels increasing the chance of blockage or clot. </li>
    <li><strong>Diabetes </strong> - High glucose levels from diabetes can damage your blood vessels. Many people with diabetes also have high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and are overweight which further increases risk. </li>
    <li><strong>High Cholesterol </strong> - High levels of bad cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries and restrict the flow of blood. It also increases the chance of a blood clot developing. </li>
    <li><strong>Diet and Physical Inactivity </strong> - An unhealthy diet and lack of exercise can affect blood pressure, cholesterol levels and put you at risk for other non-communicable disease like Diabetes. </li>
    <li><strong>Obesity </strong> - Excess body weight has been linked to high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke. </li>
    <li><strong>Heart Diseases </strong> - Cardiomyopathy, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and other heart conditions may cause blood clots that can lead to stroke.</li>

<span class="h6">STROKE TREATMENT </span> <br>
<p style="font-size:14px;" class="text-justify">Early treatment can decrease the potential damage to your heart. Even if you're not sure if something is really wrong, you should get to a hospital if you experience symptoms of a stroke.  Approximately 80% of strokes in adults are preventable, however after having a stroke; risks are much higher for having another one. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits and managing key risk factors, including high blood pressure and smoking can help lower risks.
</p> <br>
<span class="h6">STROKE RECOVERY</span> <br>
<p style="font-size:14px;"class="text-justify">Not all strokes have the same effects; as a result, everyone's path to recovery is different. For some the effects may seem minor however, some people may be left with more serious long-term effects such as physical or communication challenges. Recovering from a stroke may involve making physical, social and, emotional changes. Changes may include:
<br> <br>
    <li>Quitting smoking </li>
<li>A healthy diet </li>
<li>Maintaining a healthy weight </li>
<li>Being physically active</li>
<li>Relationship changes due to possible new limitations</li>
<li>Income and expenses may change depending on the effects of stroke experienced</li> <br> 

Recovery takes time and patience, coping with the impact of stroke is not easy. Make sure to work closely with your doctor and lean on your support system.
